# Holiday 14-day-Polyglot-Challenge
Want to join me in a 14-day Polyglot Challenge? No ice buckets or dance moves required—just some coding skills and creativity!

Here’s the deal: For 14 days, write a bit of code every evening for [Project Euler](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges)—a collection of 200+ math-inspired problems ranging from beginner-friendly to downright tricky. The twist? You can’t use the same programming language twice.

For example, I might tackle "Multiples of 3 and 5" in Java, "Summation of Primes" in Python, and throw in some retro languages like Ada for "Counting Sundays" or Fortran for "Quadratic Primes."

## FAQ:
1. How do I win?

   It's like a TikTok challenge; everybody wins.
2. Where do I post code?

   You can create a PR here, and I'll merge it, or you can create your own or maybe don't post it at all.
3. This is a dumb challenge. What's the point?
   
   It's like a TikTok challenge; there is no point (other than to put off holiday shopping)
4. Do I get more points for solving harder problems?

   Sure but there are no points and no winners. Just have fun and keep your own "score". Also, I have a million points already so I win!
